# Sales-Analysis---Power-Bi-Dashboard
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data using Power BI. I connected and transformed raw data into clean, structured datasets, ensuring accuracy and consistency. The analysis focused on several key aspects of sales performance, including:

Total Sales: Analyzed overall revenue generation.
Top Performing Products: Identified products contributing the most to sales.
Sales Trends: Monitored sales fluctuations over time to detect patterns and seasonal trends.
Customer Behavior: Examined purchasing trends, customer segments, and preferences.
Salesperson Performance: Evaluated individual and team sales contributions.
Profitability Analysis: Compared revenue with costs to calculate profits and assess financial performance.
I utilized advanced DAX functions for calculations and created interactive visualizations such as charts, tables, and filters for deeper insights. The dashboard provided actionable insights to enhance sales strategies, optimize product offerings, and improve overall business performance.
MoM Calculation: Implemented advanced DAX functions to accurately compute Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in sales, providing insights into sales growth trends.
KPI Card Enhancements: Added reference labels for KPIs, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation. Additionally, I applied formatting to the KPI section for a professional and clean presentation of key metrics.
Profit Percentage Gauge Chart: Designed a gauge chart to visualize profit percentages, helping stakeholders quickly assess profitability relative to targets.
Dynamic Trend Analysis: Utilized field parameters to create a dynamic trend analysis chart, allowing users to explore trends across different dimensions interactively.
Shipment Analysis: Developed a histogram with a zoom slider to analyze shipment data, giving detailed insight into shipping performance across different time frames.
Salesperson Performance: Created an intuitive table design to evaluate the performance of individual salespeople, highlighting key metrics such as sales contributions and targets achieved.
Product Performance Table: Designed a performance table to assess product-wise performance, focusing on metrics like sales, profitability, and customer demand.
Bookmarking Feature: Implemented a bookmark feature to switch between "Product" and "People" views, offering flexibility in data analysis and enabling users to focus on specific dimensions of interest.
